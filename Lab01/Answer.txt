2.2.6 
1. first-degree equation (linear equation) with one variable
- No solution if a = 0, b != 0
- Infinite solution if a = 0, b = 0
- One solution if a != 0, x = -b / a

2.The second-degree equation with one variable 
- No solution if determinant = 0 and D1 != 0 or D2 !=0
- Infinite solution if determinant = D1 = D2 = 0
- One solution x = D1 / D, y = D2 / D
